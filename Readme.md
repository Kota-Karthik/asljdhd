# Image Resizer App

This project is a FastAPI-based web application that allows users to upload an image, resize it into multiple predefined or custom sizes, and post the resized images to X (formerly Twitter) using the X API. The application includes an intuitive and responsive frontend UI to facilitate image uploads.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image from their device.
- **Image Resizing:** Automatically resize the image into specific dimensions (default sizes: 300x250, 728x90, 160x600, 300x600). Users can also provide custom sizes.
- **Social Posting:** Use the X API (via Tweepy) to post the resized images to the user's account.
- **CORS Support:** Ensures the backend can communicate with the frontend across different domains.
- **Error Handling:** Manages edge cases like unsupported image formats, file size limits, and API errors.
- **Cross-Platform:** The app is designed to work on iOS, Android, and Desktop browsers.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pip**
- (Optional) **Docker** for containerized deployment

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-link.git
   cd image-resizer-app/backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**

   - Copy the provided `.env-example` to create your own `.env` file:

     ```bash
     cp .env-example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file and fill in your X (Twitter) API credentials:

     ```env
     TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
     TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
     TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret_here
     ```

   **Note:** Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.

## Running the Application

1. **Run the FastAPI Backend:**

   In the `backend` folder, run:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

2. **Access the Frontend:**

   - Open the `static/index.html` file in your browser.
   - Alternatively, serve the `static` folder using any static file server.

## Testing the Application

### API Testing

- **Upload Endpoint (`/upload/`):**
  - Accepts a POST request with form data:
    - `file`: The image file.
    - `sizes` (optional): Comma-separated dimensions (e.g., `300x250,728x90`).
  - Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `cURL` to test.

### Frontend Testing

- Use the provided `index.html` file in the `static` directory to test image upload.
- Ensure your FastAPI server is running and accessible from the frontend.


## Additional Information

- **Custom Image Sizes:** When using the `/upload/` endpoint, you can specify custom image sizes. For example, entering `300x250,600x400` will resize the image to those dimensions.
- **X API Integration:** The app uses Tweepy for connecting with the X (Twitter) API. Ensure that your credentials are valid and that your application is set up correctly on the X Developer Portal.

## Troubleshooting

- **Unsupported Image Format:** Verify that you are uploading a valid image file.
- **API Errors:** Check the API response details and verify your X API credentials.
- **CORS Issues:** Confirm that your browser or environment permits requests to the backend API URL.
